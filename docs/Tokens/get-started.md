# Tokens

Tokens are units of value in the blockchain networks. While cryptocurrencies come under the categeory of tokens, tokens can be used in wide contexts other than value transfer. Cryptocurrencies are the native assets of a specific blockchain protocol, whereas tokens are created by platforms that build on top of those blockchains. In the case of NEWRL chain the native currency is called 'newrl' token. 

Newrl makes it easy for developers and users to quicly create their own tokens, transfer and use them. The inbuild tokens library in newrl take away the complexities of defining your own contract to create a token type. For more on how to work on tokens, Refer to tokens under developer section.
