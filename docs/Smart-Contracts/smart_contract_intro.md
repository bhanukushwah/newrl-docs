# Introduction


Newrlâ€™s smart contract model differs from traditional EVM-enabled blockchains.
Traditional EVM-based contract combines code/logic and state into a single contract that is deployed on-chain.
In contrast, a smart contract on Newrl contains program logic only and are instances of a templates whose state are maintained via private states (State table). Once the smart contract is deployed, it can be accessed by external accounts, and these accounts interact with the program to store program interaction-related data.

Newrl comes with preloaded widely used templates like:
1. Treasury Contract
2. DEX
3. Stake Contract
and many more to be added later.
