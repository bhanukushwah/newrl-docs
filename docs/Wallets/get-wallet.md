# Get a wallet on chain

Newrl supports zero balance wallets. Hence it need to be added on chain explicitly and not triggered by a value transfer. 

A wallet need to be generated with any of the following method
1. From the Newrl node at the time of installation
2. Using Newrl wallet app - [wallet.newrl.net](wallet.newrl.net)
3. With Newrl SDK or own key generation from code

Once the wallet is generated, it need to be activated and added to the chain by a custodian by the process mentioned in [wallets page](/wallets)
